# Network Troubleshooting & Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

This repository documents hands-on **network troubleshooting and root cause analysis (RCA)** labs focused on diagnosing and resolving **Layer 1–3 network failures**.

The work emphasizes a **structured troubleshooting methodology**, realistic failure scenarios, and validation of fixes through repeat testing. Scenarios are designed to reflect common issues encountered in **NOC and network support environments**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### scenarios/
Defined network failure scenarios used as the starting point for each RCA exercise.

Each scenario outlines:
- Network context and topology
- Symptoms and observed behavior
- Scope and impact of the issue

---

### rca/
Root Cause Analysis documentation for each scenario.

Each RCA typically includes:
- Problem statement
- Troubleshooting approach
- Isolation steps
- Root cause identification
- Corrective action
- Validation and verification

---

### evidence/
Supporting artifacts collected during troubleshooting and validation, such as:
- Cisco IOS command output
- Connectivity test results
- Before/after state comparisons

Evidence is used to support conclusions and confirm resolution.

## 🧭 Troubleshooting Methodology

Scenarios in this repository follow a structured approach:
1. Identify symptoms and scope
2. Form hypotheses
3. Test assumptions using IOS commands and tools
4. Isolate the root cause
5. Apply corrective action
6. Validate service restoration

This mirrors real-world NOC and network support workflows.
